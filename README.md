# 🦁 Dobutsu Shogi Game 🐰

A **simplified strategy game** inspired by **Dobutsu Shogi**, developed as part of our **CS150 course project**. This game retains the essence of traditional Shogi while being easy to learn and fun to play!

### Similar to Chess ♟️, but Simpler  
Dobutsu Shogi (also called **"Animal Chess"**) is a **mini version of Shogi**, Japan’s version of chess. The game is played on a **3×4 board** with only **four pieces per player**:  
- 🦁 **Lion** – Moves **one step** in any direction (like the King in Chess).  
- 🐘 **Elephant** – Moves **diagonally** in any direction.  
- 🦅 **Hawk** – Moves **vertically & horizontally** (like a Rook in Chess).  
- 🐰 **Rabbit** – Moves **one step forward** (like a Pawn in Chess).  

### How to Win  
You **win** by either:  
1. **Capturing the opponent’s Lion** (like checkmating a King in Chess).  
2. **Moving your Lion to the last row** of the opponent’s side (promotion victory).  

### Capturing & Dropping Pieces  
Unlike chess, **captured pieces can be reused** by the opponent! When you capture a piece, you can **drop it back into play on your turn**.
